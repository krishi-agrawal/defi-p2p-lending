# Defi - P2P Lending App
Small business owners often face exploitation by moneylenders when seeking loans. They are subjected to exorbitant and unfair interest rates, manipulated by middlemen, and forced into a system where the lender holds all the power. This leaves borrowers vulnerable to financial abuse. Additionally, the loan process is often slow and requires extensive manual effort.  

This app addresses this issue with  decentralized financial peer-to-peer lending. Built on Ethereum blockchain technology, it ensures fairness, transparency, and efficiency while eliminating intermediaries and empowering borrowers.
